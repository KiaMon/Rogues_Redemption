# concept for the respawn module
# does not work currently, according to chatGPT this is because the original code "deletes" the 1 every time the player moves, triggering the respawn every single time
# not sure how to fix but I think something needs to be done about how the 1 is replaced when the player moves...

  if (!(any(map == 1))) {
    cat("I'm back home. My head hurts. What happened?\n")
    map[1,1] <- 1
  }
